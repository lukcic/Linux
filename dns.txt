Forward resolving - names to IP                 
Most significant part starts on right side:         nubark.atrust.com. to 63.173.189.1

Reverse resolving - IP to names
Most significant site starts on left side:          1.189.173.63.in-addr.arpa. to nubark.atrust.com.

Name Server:
-answers users (domain to IP)
-resolves users local queries
-buffer responses
-communicate with other servers to synchronize database

NS types:
-authoritative      -officaial zone representative (master and slaves), authorative response guarantee correct data
-nonauthoritative   -answers with buffered data, do not know if data is still correct

-master (primary)   -main server for this zone, stores zones config files
-slave (secondary)  -copies zone data from master, must be minimum 1

-stub               -slave that copies only nameservers entries for zone
-distribution       -server is visible olny in given domain range

-caching            -buffers data from last requests, do not have own zones (nonauthorative)
-forwareder         -send requests for many clients, creates large buffer

-recursive          -ask all severs in path to get full answer for client
-nonrecursive       -if can`t respond, sent in request address of another DNS server, client must handle this

Servers accessile from internet must be nonrecursive - avoid cache poisoning.
Name severs form resolv.conf must be reccursive - browsers libraries do not handle DNS references (odes≈Çania).

Resources records - records about hosts in zone:

atrust.com (forward resolving:)
nubark  IN A 63.173.189.1
        IN MX 10 mailserver.atrust.com.     # name can be empty if it`s the same as above

HOST - resolves domain name to IPv4 & IPv6 (A record), also show some DNS entries (MX) if available.
host [DOMAIN_NAME]

DIG - Domain Information Grouper. 
dig [DOMAIN_NAME]

NSLOOKUP forward and reverse resolving
nslookup [DOMAIN_NAME]
nslookup [IP]
