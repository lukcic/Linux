CURL - commandline http client

>               -request    
<               -response
Accept: */*     -client will accept any type of content as response

curl -s -v -o /dev/null http://admin.com
-v          -verbose
-s          -silent mode: don`t show progress meter or error messages
-o <file>   -output to file
-H "HEADER" -send custom header
-O <file>   -download file from server #curl -O https://curl.haxx.se/snapshots/curl-7.56.0-20170913.tar.xz

curl -H "Host: www.admin.com" -s -v -o /dev/null 54.239.192.53      #will check if server will response the same from www.admin.com as admin.com

cURL -copy as URL, Google chrome function that generates curl command whoch simulates browser work

Cookies
Flags: http ony, secure
path
time to use
volume (1MB?), types of content? 

Base 64 - encoding data (binary to text for sending), increase volume (1.33x) 
graphics in css as base 64. Multiple sending the same data, if overhead (narzut: 1.33) is smaller than http headers its better to have graphics in css (small files)

Security headers - give browser information how to handle my site
-X-XSS-Protection - do not run scripts from outside 

-X-Frame-Options do not put my site in iframe

-Content-Security-Policy -use whitelist of elements and domains on my site

-Strict-Transport-Security -do not go back from https to http (http is invisible for browser)

-Secure -cookies are transported only using https

-Httponly -Java Script do not see cookies (they are only for html)

-Refferer-Policy - browser will not send refferer outside (refferer - address bar, domain and rest)

-

Cache headers 

reverse proxy (how long collect data)
