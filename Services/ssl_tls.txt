HTTP with TLS
TLS (Transport Security Layer) - independent layer between HTTP and TCP (TLS is not interfering in HTTP). 
Used because HTTP do not handle security - messages are send in plain text. 
Client application is checking server identity while connecting. 

SSL certificates:
-encryption of data transfered between server and browser
-make sure that taken data are not changed
-ensure that you connected right host

SSL verification types:
-DV -Domain Validation, make sure that domain is valid (Let`s Encrypt)
-OV -Organization Validation, make sure that company is valid, company name seeing in browser 
-EV -Extended Validation, make sure that you are owner of trademark (uded  by banks etc.) 


openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj /CN=localhost -keyout files/nginx.key -out files/nginx.crt

SNI (server Name Indication) - client sends virtual host name in the beginning of TLS connection, to check which domain is request for, before http header decryption.
