Permissions in directories:
-file`s write permission let user to change or delete content of file.
-deleting and changing name of file depends of directory permissions.
-in directory executable bit lets you go inside of direcoty, but for listing content of directowy you must have read an executable bit (both).  
-save and ececutable bit together lets you to create, delete and renaming files inside directory.
-to show dir permissions use 'ls -ld'

9-bit permissions are mostly overrided by: ACLs, SELinux module or additiona permissions bits:

setuid & setgid
Set user id (4000), set group id (2000), mode (s- special bit, replace x in permissions) used to giving programs (executable files) higher priviledges, than their user have, 
for example: sudo, passwd (setting uid of user who password must be changed). 
If setgid is given to directory, then files created inside have group owner of directory group owner (not file creator`s group). It is used to work of directory as a group of users.
setuid & setgig may be disable with mount option: nosuid.

SUID (set Used ID) - +s on user x, octal value 4.
Given only for executable files.  gives possibility to run file with permissions of user who owns the file (eg. root).

SGID (set GID) - +s on group x, octal value 2 before permission number. 
Given for executable files - gives possibility to run file with permissions of group who owns the file (eg. root group). 
Given for executable dirs -  newly created files have group inherited from directory. 

chmod [code] [FILE] -set permissions to file
-R  -recursive (do not use on directories- find files)
--reference=file1 file2  -set for file2 the same permission as file1 has

chown [user] [file] -change file owner
chgrp [group] [file] -change group owner
chown [user]:[group] [file] -change both

umask - gives default permissions of newly created files, umask have different values than files and folders octal mode (you set the permissions that are taken out).
umask -S  -show umask in readable mode
umask 022 - new files can be accessed by everyone
umask 077 -new files can be accessed only by user

Sticky bit - directories with "t" instead x on 'others' permissions. 
Sticky bit (1000) - if set on directory, then only file or directory owner (and root) can delete files inside directory (even if other users have permissions).

Special file attributes:
They depends of used filesystem type (E - ext3 and ext4, B- BTRFS, X - xfs):
A -XBE - do not change access time (st_atime), used for better performance
a -XBE - save only as APPEND
C -B - turn off copy-on-write upgrade
c -B - compress file
D -BE - synchronized saving directories upgrade
d -XBE - do not archive file (backup software should leave this file)
i -XBE - file is unchangable and cannot be deleted (Windows read-only)
J -E - save data change journal wit metadata
S -XBE - synchronized saved changes (without buffering)
X -X - do not compress data if it used by default

PAM - Pluggable Access Module
Access control mechanism that use many types of login methods. If program wants to authenticate user, asks PAM for it.

Kerberos -network kryptographic access control mechanism that works with PAM. 
You are auhenticacing on server, thats gives information to host about pass you or not.

S. 183
ACL - Access Control list. You can give file permissions to individual users (like in Windows), not only owner, group and everybody. 
getfacl [FILE] -show permissions

$ setfacl -m u:tecmint1:rwx example/
$ setfacl -m u:tecmint2:r-- example/
$ setfacl -m  other:--- example/
$ getfacl example/

# file: example
# owner: tecmint1
# group: tecmint1
user::rwx
user:tecmint1:rwx
user:tecmint2:r--
group::r-x
mask::rwx
other::---

LSM -Linux Security Modules (SELinux, AppArmor, Smack, TOMOYO and Yama)
This modules use API LSM and works as additional kernel modules used to access control.

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) -admins can use own centralised access control rules, 
for example only user can view his home folder even if he changed 'other' permission to read. 

SELinux - one of the oldest MAC mechanism. Used in Android. To protect daemon, SELinux policy must include all files and dirs used by this process.
seedit.sourceforge.net  - config editor for SELinux

/etc/selinux/config:
SELINUX=enforcing       #enforcing - policy must be active and unauthorizes access is blocked
                        #permissive - policy can be violated (pogwa≈Çcony), but everything will be logged (used to testing rules)
                        #disabled - SELinux is disabled
SELINUXTYPE=targeted    #policy database name (dir in /etc/selinux), only one at once. Targeted - used in RedHat, focus on choosen daemons only (rest is not checked)

AppArmor - Canonical product used in Ubuntu and Debian and even Suse
Tis MAC module is extension for traditional access mechanism in Linux. 
It concentrates on protecting daemons by filtering their work by AppArmon profile.
By default AppArmon discards all requests, so you must configure what given process can do. 
Apps without profie works the same like without AppArmor. Profiles are stored in  /etc/apparmor.d.
They include files list, that daemon can work on with permissions.
